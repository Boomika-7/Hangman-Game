# Hangman-Game

The objective of the game is to uncover the hidden word. You'll see a series of blank spaces representing the letters of the word. To play, select a letter by clicking on it. If the letter is part of the word, all its occurrences will be revealed in the correct positions. Once you've revealed enough letters, you can try to guess the complete word by filling in the remaining blanks. 

Be cautious! Every incorrect guess costs you a life, and a piece of the hangman appears. Use hints strategically to help identify the word. Your goal is to solve the puzzle before the hangman is fully drawn.

**EASY LEVEL:** The hidden word contains three letters. It could be an animal, insect, bird, a part of the human body, or an everyday object.

**HARD LEVEL:** The hidden word contains seven letters. It might refer to a vegetable, a food item, the name of a country, or something similar.
